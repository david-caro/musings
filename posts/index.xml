      <description>I have decided to setup a little space for myself to write down some stuff I might want to refer to at a later time, hoping that it might be helpful for someone also at some point.
I have decided to do it with Hugo, so far so good :)
Some of the things I&amp;rsquo;m enjoying:
hugo serve that starts the server locally autoreloads when any changes are made (nice) it was simpler to get started than Jekyll </description>
