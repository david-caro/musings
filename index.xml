      <description>Today I decided to fix one thing that annoyed me, and that was the new email color for the evolution mail client when it&amp;rsquo;s using the dark mode.
After some reading found this, and voilà, it worked :)
So here&amp;rsquo;s the snippet I used on the file ~/.config/gtk-3.0/gtk.css:
MessageList,* { -MessageList-new-mail-bg-color: darkblue; } Awesome \o/</description>

      <description>My main server died the other day, and it was the one running envoy for the rest of the lab hosts, so I decided to move envoy to one of the raspberry pi 4 that I have idling around.
First try Now, these raspberries are running debian bullseye, but it seems that envoy does not build packages for debian, and Tetrate (the ones that build some) stopped building them in 2021 :/</description>

      <description>Something curious found ot today, and I don&amp;rsquo;t want to lose, is how to overwrite the instance label in prometheus, specifically, we have an exporter (openstack-exporter) that exposes some metrics, and it populates one label sometimes named hostname.
But for several reasons when dealing with the metrics we only filter by instance, problem is, that the instance metric is usually the address/name of the target prometheus is pulling the metrics from, and is this case that does not match the hostname.</description>

      <description>Lately I have been curious to try to know if certain linux users are accessing certain resources, in an effort to discover and expose dependencies between services.
This users are actually the ones with which containers are being run with from k8s itself (in toolforge, each k8s user has a linux user, and it&amp;rsquo;s containers run as that user).
To do so, I wrote a small golang script. Here&amp;rsquo;s some notes on trying to get that information.</description>

      <description>I have decided to setup a little space for myself to write down some stuff I might want to refer to at a later time, hoping that it might be helpful for someone also at some point.
I have decided to do it with Hugo, so far so good :)
Some of the things I&amp;rsquo;m enjoying:
hugo serve that starts the server locally autoreloads when any changes are made (nice) it was simpler to get started than Jekyll </description>
