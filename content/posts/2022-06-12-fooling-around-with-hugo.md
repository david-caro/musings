I have decided to setup a little space for myself to write down some stuff I might want to refer to
at a later time, hoping that it might be helpful for someone also at some point.

I have decided to do it with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), so far so good :)

Some of the things I'm enjoying:
* `hugo serve` that starts the server locally autoreloads when any changes are made (nice)
* it was simpler to get started than [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
