      <description>Today let&amp;rsquo;s have a look to a single particle, going around without any potential. So we get the same time-independent Schrödinger equation as we got inside the infinite square well:&#xA;$$ -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{d^2\psi}{dx^2} = E\psi $$&#xA;A single solution for this is the same as for the infinite well, but this time we will use the exponential form, as that will help us later:&#xA;$$ \psi(x) = Ae^{ikx} + Be^{-ikx} \hspace{0.5cm}\text{where }k=\frac{\sqrt{2mE}}{\hbar} $$</description>

      <description>Harmonic oscillatoa This time let&amp;rsquo;s give a look at the harmonic oscillator. This is a very useful case, as most curved potentials can be aproximated at their local minimums as harmonic oscillators.&#xA;In a classical frictionless harmonic oscillator, we had the force (Hooke&amp;rsquo;s law):&#xA;$$ F = -kx = m\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} $$&#xA;The solution for this is (as we saw in the infinite well):&#xA;$$ x(t) = A\sin{\omega t} + B\cos{\omega t} $$</description>

      <description>Lately I have had some extra quiet time due to medical conditions, and I took on some quantum mechanics. I followed the MIT 8.04 course on OCW, but I&amp;rsquo;m also following the great &amp;lsquo;Introduction to Quantum Mechanics&amp;rsquo; book by David Griffiths and Darrell Schroeter.&#xA;That made me rediscover my local library, and also &amp;lsquo;Numerical Methods in Physycs with Python&amp;rsquo; by Alex Gerzerlis and that combination gives this series of articles on both, python and physics with some summaries, exercises and musings on the subject.</description>
