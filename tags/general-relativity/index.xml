      <description>Previous post in the series If you did not check it out, the first part of this post is here.&#xA;Tensors, revisited Playing with tensors Some tensor definitions:&#xA;Symmetric tensor: Is a tensor in which the coordinates are the same by swapping any set of indices, for the first two indices:&#xA;$$ T_{\mu\nu\rho} = T_{\nu\mu\rho} $$&#xA;For the last two:&#xA;$$ T_{\mu\nu\rho} = T_{\mu\rho\nu} $$&#xA;For all of them:&#xA;$$ T_{\mu\nu\rho} = T_{\mu\rho\nu} = T_{\rho\mu\nu} = T_{\rho\nu\mu} = T_{\nu\mu\rho} = T_{\nu\rho\mu} $$</description>

      <description>Lately, I have started learning a bit about general relativity, and one of the most basic concepts is a tensor, in this post I&amp;rsquo;ll try to write down some basic concepts.&#xA;Some definitions Note that all these definitions are of geometric entities that are independent of the coordinates chosen to describe them. This will be very important as will allow us to describe physics the same way independently of the coordinates and generalize the results.</description>
