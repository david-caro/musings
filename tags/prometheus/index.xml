      <description>Something curious found ot today, and I don&amp;rsquo;t want to lose, is how to overwrite the instance label in prometheus, specifically, we have an exporter (openstack-exporter) that exposes some metrics, and it populates one label sometimes named hostname.&#xA;But for several reasons when dealing with the metrics we only filter by instance, problem is, that the instance metric is usually the address/name of the target prometheus is pulling the metrics from, and is this case that does not match the hostname.</description>
