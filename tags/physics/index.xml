      <description>Lately, I have started learning a bit about general relativity, and one of the most basic concepts is a tensor, in this post I&amp;rsquo;ll try to write down some basic concepts.&#xA;Some definitions Note that all these definitions are of geometric entities that are independent of the coordinates chosen to describe them. This will be very important as will allow us to describe physics the same way independently of the coordinates and generalize the results.</description>

      <description>Today let&amp;rsquo;s have a look to a single particle, going around without any potential. So we get the same time-independent Schrödinger equation as we got inside the infinite square well:&#xA;$$ -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{d^2\psi}{dx^2} = E\psi $$&#xA;A single solution for this is the same as for the infinite well, but this time we will use the exponential form, as that will help us later:&#xA;$$ \psi(x) = Ae^{ikx} + Be^{-ikx} \hspace{0.5cm}\text{where }k\equiv\frac{\sqrt{2mE}}{\hbar} $$</description>

      <description>Harmonic oscillatoa This time let&amp;rsquo;s give a look at the harmonic oscillator. This is a very useful case, as most curved potentials can be aproximated at their local minimums as harmonic oscillators.&#xA;In a classical frictionless harmonic oscillator, we had the force (Hooke&amp;rsquo;s law):&#xA;$$ F = -kx = m\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} $$&#xA;The solution for this is (as we saw in the infinite well):&#xA;$$ x(t) = A\sin{\omega t} + B\cos{\omega t} $$</description>

      <description>Lately I have had some extra quiet time due to medical conditions, and I took on some quantum mechanics. I followed the MIT 8.04 course on OCW, but I&amp;rsquo;m also following the great &amp;lsquo;Introduction to Quantum Mechanics&amp;rsquo; book by David Griffiths and Darrell Schroeter.&#xA;That made me rediscover my local library, and also &amp;lsquo;Numerical Methods in Physycs with Python&amp;rsquo; by Alex Gerzerlis and that combination gives this series of articles on both, python and physics with some summaries, exercises and musings on the subject.</description>
