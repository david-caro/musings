      <description>Lately I have had some extra quiet time due to medical conditions, and I took on some quantum mechanics. I followed the MIT 8.04 course on OCW, but I&amp;rsquo;m also following the great &amp;lsquo;Introduction to Quantum Mechanics&amp;rsquo; book by David Griffiths and Darrell Schroeter.&#xA;That made me rediscover my local library, and also &amp;lsquo;Numerical Methods in Physycs with Python&amp;rsquo; by Alex Gerzerlis and that combination gives this series of articles on both, python and physics with some summaries, exercises and musings on the subject.</description>
